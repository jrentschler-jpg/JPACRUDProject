# JPACRUDProject

##Overview
This application performs simple CRUD on a one table database of any topic we wanted to choose. I created a Wine Directory that a user could search by wine id, create a new wine to be added to the database, update a wine and then search the newly added wine either by the id or the name of the wine, delete a wine - it will let the user know the wine has been deleted and gives them the option to go back to the home page also if they were to search the wine that was deleted by id or name it will let them know "No such wine found", search by wine name, and display the list of wines currently in the database.

## Struggles
I think one of the biggest struggles I had was mapping from my Controller to the JSP files. This gave me more practice working in the Controller and seeing how the Controller talks to the JSP's. Once I was able to stand the logic, it all clicked!! I was actually really nervous about this project at first, since I knew it was going to be a FullStack project and worried about if I would be able to successfully connect all the dots, this gave me a lot of confidence in the knowledge I have learned in the last 9 weeks! This really helped prepare us for our Mid-Terms next week.  


## Lessons Learned
I actually had a lot of fun with this project! This was my first project where it was a FullStack project. It was so cool to see how the stack parts are all inner connected. Building the database back-end all the way up to the front-end of the Spring Boot design and looks of the page.

## Project Instructions

## Application Overview
This weeks homework is going to perform simple CRUD on a single table database of your choosing.

## Learning Objectives
Below are a list of objectives that we see the JPACrud application reinforcing.

1. Creating a SQL database and subsequent tables.
2. Configuring a JPA project.
3. Mapping Entities to SQL tables.
4. Creating JUnit tests to ensure our JPA mappings are correct.
5. Integrating a Spring MVC project with a JPA project.
6. Performing basic CRUD operations.
7. Deploying an application to AWS


## Project Requirement
You'll push your project to a Github repo named JPACRUDProject. Be sure to include a README.md detailing the technologies used as well as the purpose of the application.

1. Your project utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data. For this project you are only required to have a single table and entity.

2. The MySQL table is mapped to a valid JPA Entity and tested to ensure the mappings are working correctly.

3. A Spring project allows for a user to perform basic CRUD operations on your entity via a web interface.

4. Your project and database are deployed to your AWS instance.

## Stretch Goals
Try as many of these as you like, but ONLY after you've completed, tested, and COMMITTED your working application that meets the requirements.

Perform CRUD operations on more that one entity. We will learn about relationships and joining tables with JPA next week so for now you will not be able to handle foreign key relationships.


## Grading
This is a graded project. You are expected to have your project completed by the start of class on Monday morning.

You will be given either a pass or fail based on whether your code works and meets the above specified requirements.

If the project does meet these specifications, you will be given a 1 for this week's project.

If the project does not work, you will be given a 0 for this week's project.

If you get a zero on the project, you can upgrade to a score of .5 if you turn in a working project by the start of class on the following Monday morning AND notify an instructor that you wish to get partial credit.

To turn in a project, you must push it to GitHub. You must include a README.md that describes how to run your program. Include an overview of the class structure you chose to use.
