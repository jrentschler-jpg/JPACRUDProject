# JPACRUDProject

##Overview
This application performs simple CRUD on a one table database of any topic we wanted to choose. I created a Wine Directory that a user could search by wine id, create a new wine to be added to the database, update a wine and then search the newly added wine either by the id or the name of the wine, delete a wine - it will let the user know the wine has been deleted and gives them the option to go back to the home page also if they were to search the wine that was deleted by id or name it will let them know "No such wine found", search by wine name, and display the list of wines currently in the database.

## Struggles
I think one of the biggest struggles I had was mapping from my Controller to the JSP files. This gave me more practice working in the Controller and seeing how the Controller talks to the JSP's. Once I was able to stand the logic, it all clicked!! I was actually really nervous about this project at first, since I knew it was going to be a FullStack project and worried about if I would be able to successfully connect all the dots, this gave me a lot of confidence in the knowledge I have learned in the last 9 weeks! This really helped prepare us for our Mid-Terms next week.  


## Lessons Learned
I actually had a lot of fun with this project! This was my first project where it was a FullStack project. It was so cool to see how the stack parts are all inner connected. Building the database back-end all the way up to the front-end of the Spring Boot design and looks of the page.
